ghink
=====

ghink is a [github pages] [1] [InK] [6] boilerplate. An easy way to start a beautiful, responsive, self-hosted, blog or website.

Developing model and contributing
---------------------------------

We use the [Git flow] [9] workflow with ghink with a few nuances. Essencially we only use the develop and gh-pages branches. Day to day development goes into the develop branch of the project, which eventually merges into the gh-pages branch, our production ready releases bucket, which in turn triggers the [Ghink website] [10], thanks to the Github Pages service.

Welcome to [Ghink][1], a [Github Pages][3], plus [Jekyll][4], plus [InK][2] boilerplate. An easy way to start a beautiful, responsive, self-hosted, blog or website.

If you need technical information on how to start your Ghink website environment, head up to our [Github repo][1].

Otherwise, read the example blog posts on the boilerplate to find how to use this framework and extend it to your needs.

Ghink is heavily based on [InK][2]. We suggest you look it up first before you start, to understand the basics behind it.

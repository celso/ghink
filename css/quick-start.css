/** 
 * Sets the grids maximum width
 * @var $grid-max-width (pixels|ems|percentage)
 */
/*!
 * Sets the grids breakpoint
 * 
 * To add a new break point you'll need to add an element to the list.
 * 
 * Here's an example: ( class-name-prefix, minimum-width, maximum-width, gutter-width, no-media-query).
 * 
 * class-name-prefix: this is the prefix used in tons of inks classes i.e.: large-100, small-40, etc.
 * minimum-width: (pixels|null) the minimum width for the breakpoint 
 * maximum-width: (pixels|null) the maximum width for the breakpoint 
 * gutter-width: (ems) the width for the gutters (space between grid columns) for the breakpoint 
 * no-media-query: (true|false) if you need to support IE8 set this to true on a single breakpoint.
 *                 Since IE8 does not support the @media statement leaving one of the breakpoints
 *                 outside a @media query let's you use the grid in IE8.

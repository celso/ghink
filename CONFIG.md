_config.yml
===========

The [_config.yml][2] file is at the center of your website behavior and features. It's used both to configure the [Jekyll][1] parser and a bunch of local website parameters.

Local parameters
----------------

> disqus_shortname: "shortname"

If you want to use [Disqus][3] comments in your website blog posts, all you need is to set the `disqus_shortname` variable with the Disqus shortname for your Website.

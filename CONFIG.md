_config.yml
===========

The [_config.yml][2] file is at the center of your website behavior and features. It's used both to configure the [Jekyll][1] parser and a bunch of local website parameters.

Local parameters
----------------

> disqus_shortname: "shortname"

If you want to use [Disqus][3] comments in your website blog posts, all you need is to set the `disqus_shortname` variable with the Disqus shortname for your Website.

Leaflet is a modern open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. It is developed by Vladimir Agafonkin with a team of dedicated contributors. Weighing just about 31 KB of JS, it has all the features most developers ever need for online maps.

Ghink has a leaflet snippet you can use in your pages or blog posts. If you will be using it, you must set `use_leaflet: 1`.
